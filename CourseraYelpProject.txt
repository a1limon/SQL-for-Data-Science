Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 537 (foreign key: user_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT id, name, review_count, yelping_since, useful, funny, cool, fans, average_stars, compliment_hot, compliment_more, compliment_profile, compliment_cute, compliment_list, compliment_note, compliment_plain, compliment_cool, compliment_funny, compliment_writer, compliment_photos
FROM user
WHERE id = NULL or name = NULL or review_count = NULL or yelping_since = NULL or useful = NULL or funny - NULL or cool = NULL or fans = NULL or average_stars = NULL or compliment_hot = NULL or compliment_more = NULL or compliment_profile = NULL or compliment_cute = NULL or compliment_list = NULL or compliment_note = NULL or compliment_plain = NULL or compliment_cool = NULL or compliment_funny = NULL or compliment_writer = NULL or compliment_photos = NULL
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

ORDER BY stars ASC



Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):
		
+------------+-----+
| starRating | cnt |
+------------+-----+
|        2.0 |   1 |

|        4.5 |   2 |
|        5.0 |   5 |
+------------+-----+

7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT id,
name,
review_count
FROM user
ORDER BY review_count DESC
LIMIT 3;
	
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+--------+--------------+
| name   | review_count |
+--------+--------------+
| Gerald |         2000 |
| Sara   |         1629 |
| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+
		



8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

No they are not correlated. Using a similar query from Q7, if we take a look at users sorted by review count, there are a couple of cases where the top user in terms of review counts does not have as many fans as lower users. The data does seem in fact to be kind of random, and further analysis would need to be done to examine it more closely and perhaps find a correlation with another variable.
	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: love

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
SELECT 
 (SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM review
 WHERE text LIKE "%love%") as loveCount,
 
 (SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM review
 WHERE text LIKE "%hate%") as hateCount



	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT name, fans
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC
LIMIT 10;

	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |
| Gerald    |  253 |
| Christine |  173 |
| Lisa      |  159 |
| Cat       |  133 |
| William   |  126 |
| Fran      |  124 |
| Lissa     |  120 |
+-----------+------+
	
		

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
Yes
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Besides being in the same city, zip code 89118 twice and is shown to have less reviews than other zip codes, while zip codes 89103 and 89139 have a largely disproportionate number of reviews.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT b.name, b.review_count, b.postal_code, b.city, b.stars, h.hours, c.category
FROM (business AS b INNER JOIN hours as h ON b.id = h.business_id) INNER JOIN category as c ON h.business_id = c.business_id
WHERE b.city LIKE "Las Vegas%" and c.category = "Food"
GROUP BY b.stars

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         The business that is open has lower stars
ii. Difference 2:
         The business that is closed has higher review count
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT b.name, b.review_count, b.postal_code, b.city, b.stars, h.hours, c.category, b.is_open
FROM (business AS b INNER JOIN hours as h ON b.id = h.business_id) INNER JOIN category as c ON h.business_id = c.business_id
WHERE b.city LIKE "Las Vegas%" and c.category = "Food"
GROUP BY b.is_open

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Sentiment analysis to predict the star rating of a review.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

 The main data type I will need for sentiment analysis is text data or strings. Since I want to try to identify and quantify subjective information I have to look at keywords or parse out certain words in reviews or other business attributes and attempt to interpret the data. Given the ER diagram for this Yelp dataset I can also utilize the number of stars from the business table, which is a float value, to suggest or help guide my analysis.
 The review table would be the main source to look at the types of reviews customers left, but perhaps I could also look at the user table or business table to get additional information such as stars and number of reviews a user has written. Mainly I will use the text data from reviews.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

This place is not cheap nor is it too overpriced compared to other steakhouses in Las Vegas that don't even come close to this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|     3 | 2011-04-11 00:00:00 |      0 | Was excited to go here since it was Emerille's Steakhouse.  We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|       |                     |        | I ordered the filet, medium and a side of asparagus.  The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|       |                     |        | I'm no expert on gumbo, but I found it very tasty. Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|       |                     |        | The highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|     5 | 2006-03-23 00:00:00 |      1 | My client took me here after the MAGIC Show and it was phenomenal! The steak danced in my mouth. Well not really but you get the picture. The salads and sides (asparagus, potatoes) were excellent. They also have a fine wine selection. This place takes steak on another level! Highly recommended!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|       |                     |        | The plantains were delicious and the ther servers were very attentive. One nice thing that they did was they did not have enough plantains for both of our plates. So, they gave me my portion and put two on my friend's plate so they could get the meals out. They then brought a side plate with the rest of the plantains when they were finished. It was a well thought out move on the part of the staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This place is tiny and I'm sure gets packed as we went on a Tuesday morning and there was a small wait but it's so worth it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|     1 | 2014-09-17 00:00:00 |      1 | Couldn't get a table. They wouldn't give us a table for 6. They wouldn't even try.  We would have waited. Stupid.  Only 1 person working the entire place. Stupid again. I don't like giving my business to people who could care less about mine. If you feel the same then avoid this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|     3 | 2008-05-01 00:00:00 |      2 | This place can get really awesome or really dull dependent on one solitary man resembling a leprechaun with a filthy mouth and penchant for calling out mouthy toolbags, all while playing the guitar and happily caroling away in Irish drinking hymnals.  It can get really crowded, which makes standing really tedious and plants a target on your big forehead for the leprechaun to abuse.  On St. Paddy's Day, this place is chaos, and like most other forced holidays is not worth getting into the carnival atmosphere just to say you did it.  Cash-only holidays get old in a hurry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

They give a lot of french fries so we didn't need to order two entrees with fries but instead ordered one entree with fries and added additional chicken pieces and it was enough to feed three of us.  It's a cheap meal located in a residential neighborhood.  Definitely off the beaten path for us tourist.  The nata was ok.  It would have tasted better if they served it warm or at least at room temp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|     3 | 2014-05-24 00:00:00 |      0 | Years ago, I banked here. They were horrible. These days the only reason I come here is to make my mortgage payment. Saturday morning, I was the only one in line. For 10 minutes while a teller conversed with a customer about their grandkids. I get it you want to connect with your customers. Another person working the drive thru  came to the front where I thought he would help me. No such luck. Finally, a woman from the back came out and asked if I had a check deposit or a payment. She finally took my payment. One more reason to hate the big banks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|     5 | 2015-04-17 00:00:00 |      0 | Rented a van in the Mesa, AZ area.  We had an issue with a cracked window.  It wasn't apparent when we picked the car up but by the time we returned the vehicle days later the crack was over 12 inches long.  I explained the situation and Alamo did not charge us anything which we really appreciate!!!  It wasn't our fault to begin with but I don't think all companies would have believed us!  So Thanks Alamo!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|     5 | 2015-10-03 00:00:00 |      0 | Seriously the best massage I've ever had! Ariana and David are so caring and skilled! The pressure was perfect, the scents were great, the ambiance was fantastic! All in the comfort of our hotel room.  If you need (WANT) a massage this is definitely the place to get it from!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The staff are very knowledgeable and the gaming area in the back is comfortable and clean. The whole place is very welcoming. Madison has a number of game stores, but I'm Board is exceptional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|     5 | 2016-05-28 00:00:00 |      0 | I love love love love Michael Mina 's restaurants . He owns a couple at bellagio . It was a very nice experience we were greeted and seated. The waiter was extremely nice and helped us pick out what we wanted . We actually ended up doing the tasting menu. The food did take a while to cook and be ready but overall it was really nice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|     5 | 2017-07-18 00:00:00 |      0 | WOW! This place was exceptional, not only because every meal we enjoyed had a variety of options and was flavorful but also because the prices were so reasonable! I would definitely recommend Shae as your waitress. She is AWESOME! You can definitely expect a good time and great service. Sometimes, to my delight, the experience exceeds my expectations! I highly recommend anyone paying Eds a visit!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Husband thought his sandwich was ok, priced right but nothing special.  The hit of this place, as many have said, is the homemade pies!  Save room for a slice, very tasty!  Can't think of another place in town with homemade pies like these.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Richard's a lovely man, totally professional, and really knows what he's doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|     4 | 2013-08-15 00:00:00 |      0 | Great food, nice atmosphere, great location.  The tacos are good, I had one of each, very unique!  The Beast burrito is my favorite! The ceviche was tasty, but almost too chunky so it was hard to scoop on a chip. No televisions, so that can be good or bad depending on if you want to watch a game while eating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|     2 | 2016-07-05 00:00:00 |      0 | The food here is always delicious. However, the bar staff seemed unhappy and was extremely unfriendly and unwelcoming. My co-worker and I went here on a Sunday night. We both work at a bar in the North Shore that experienced an extremely busy July 4th weekend and we were exhausted and in the search of a good meal. It was impossible to get a smile from a single employee in the building. I ordered the Rhuby drink. The first one was delicious, but the second round was much sweeter and I couldnt finish it. The Shroom flat bread was amazing. My chicken sandwich and buffalo mac & cheese was great. My friend's turkey sandwich and truffle fries were also good. But the lack of friendly or attentive service or even a simple smile was disappointing. The bar was not very busy and the half the restaurant was closed. As workers in the same industry, my friend and I are very aware and understanding of the stress of working in a bar. But I couldn't even bring myself to tip as well as I normally would because the experience was so bad. |
|     4 | 2016-12-04 00:00:00 |      0 | Came here on a Sunday for lunch. We ordered the candied bacon, pot roast fries, a president salad (which was just a chicken Caesar salad) and the model turkey sandwich. Candied bacon was good, I liked the flavor a lot, not too sweet. The fries were very good as well - they gave a generous portion of the pot roast. The two main meals were ok.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|     5 | 2015-09-05 00:00:00 |      0 | I've been there twice so far probably the best gourmet style pizza place in Pittsburgh. There was not a lot of seating in the restaurant however it seems like there was enough room to add at least 5 more tables. I feel like they are not utilizing the space to its fullist potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
